Barcode Scanner

This project uses the QuaggaJS barcode scanner to scan CODE 128 barcodes into local state. It preserves images of the scanned codes along with their codes, and a label. The user can edit the label by selecting the edit icon beneath the barcode photo. The user can scroll through the list of scanned barcodes. An alert is displayed if the barcode is scanned more than once, to prevent redundant records.

Test the app using the barcode images provided. Save the provided barcodes to a mobile phone or print them out, and then hold them in front of the camera of the device you are running the app on.
